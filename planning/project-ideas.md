## Shortlist

Very Interesting
* Pierre Olivier: [Operating System Development: Contributing to the Unikraft Unikernel](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year3/project/projectbookdetails.php?projectid=55068) - look through issues in forked repos
* Ning Zhang: [Host Based Intrusion Detection in a Cloud Enviroment](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year3/project/projectbookdetails.php?projectid=55115)

Interesting
* Pierre OIivier: [Software Compartmentalisation](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year3/project/projectbookdetails.php?projectid=55069)
* Bernado Magri: [Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year3/project/projectbookdetails.php?projectid=55123)
* Ning Zhang: [Investigation of Digital Forensic Techniques](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year3/project/projectbookdetails.php?projectid=55112) (a bit too research-y; not very practical)

## Draft Emails

### Cloud Intruder Detection

Dear Ning,

My name is Tom, and I am in the Second Year of my Computer Science degree. I spent some time this evening looking at Third Year Projects and found _"Host Based Intrusion Detection in a Cloud Environment"_ extremely interesting. I am interested in the cybersecurity space and am working at [Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/ "https://www.netcraft.com/") over summer. I know application shortlisting only opens in a couple of days, but I was wondering if I could set up a quick meeting after the Easter holidays to discuss the project a bit more with you?

Until then, are there any resources that you would recommend that I look at?    

Thank you,
Kind regards

### Unikraft Unikernel

Dear Pierre,

My name is Tom, and I am in the Second Year of my Computer Science degree. I spent some time this afternoon looking at Third Year Projects and thought that _"Contributing to the Unikraft Unikernel"_ looked quite interesting. I wondered if you have any time this week where I could come and meet you and have a brief discussion about what the project would involve?

I also saw that last year you offered a project looking at unikernel design for serverless computing. I wondered if you were planning to offer it again this year, as I thought it looked incredibly interesting.

Until then, are there any resources that you would recommend that I look at, other than the Unikernel repo?    

Thank you,
Kind regards

Tom Cassar
